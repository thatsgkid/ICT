    <p>Superscript and subscript in a web page by MY NAME HERE</p>
    <h4>Enhancing Text</h4>
    <p>Text can be enhanced in many ways, it can be made italic, it can be emboldened and it can be underlined. Although it is possible to underline this text, it is not often used as this is usually used to show a Hyperlink. We will study these later when we apply CSS styles to our web page.</p>
    <p>Different styles can be applied to webpages and individual characters can be enhanced with superscript and subscript. Superscript can be used for area or volume, for example: 10 metres2 or 500 cm3. Subscript can be used with chemical formulae, for example: the chemical formula for Carbon dioxide is CO2. Other style elements are set using the styles h1 to h6, paragraph style and list style.</p>
