Tawara Balloon Safaris offer amazing early morning trips across the Maasai Mara and Serengeti national parks. Watch the animals in their element, from the air, as you silently drift overhead. As a company we have over 25 years' experience of ballooning and employ only fully qualified and experienced pilots. Our ground crew will collect you from your camp and meet you at the end of the safari with a leisurely champagne breakfast in the bush.
